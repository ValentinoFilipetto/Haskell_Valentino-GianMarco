# Intuitionistic Propositional Logic Tableaux in Haskell

We present an implementation in Haskell of a tableau-style proof system for the
implication-free fragment of intuitionistic propositional logic, drawing inspiration from a
preexisting implementation of classical first-order logic proposed here [3]. We also propose
a tableau prover for classical propositional logic, obtained via a minor modification of
the original one. These two can be used in conjunction to have experimental evidence of
Glivenkoâ€™s theorem.
